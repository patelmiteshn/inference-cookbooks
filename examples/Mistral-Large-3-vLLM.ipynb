    "## Launch OpenAI-compatible server\n",
    "\n",
    "When launching an OpenAI-compatible server, the exact configuration you use should depend heavily on the hardware available in your cluster and the level of model quantization you choose. Different GPUs and memory budgets will favor different precision settings and kernel implementations. In particular, high-end setups with multiple B200 GPUs can push for more aggressive optimizations like FP8 to maximize throughput without sacrificing too much quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are example configurations optimized for different setups. Run them in a terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the `\"$MODEL\"` variable to one of the official checkpoints published by Mistral so the launch commands pull the right weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512` (FP8, recommended for B200/H200)\n",
    "- `mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512-NVFP4` (NVFP4 for H100/A100)\n",
    "- `mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512-BF16` (full precision for fidelity testing)\n",
    "- `mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512-Eagle` (draft model for speculative decoding)\n",

    "#### FP8 on 8xB200\n",
    "\n",
    "On an 8×B200 node, we can safely run the model in FP8 to squeeze out significantly higher effective throughput and better hardware utilization. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We rely on FlashInfer kernels for both the Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) path and the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers in FP8. These kernels are optimized for modern NVIDIA architectures and are designed to reduce latency and improve tokens-per-second, especially at larger batch sizes and longer context lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The key–value (KV) cache is also kept in FP8 format. This drastically cuts memory consumption for long-context inference and allows the model to handle more concurrent requests or longer sequences without running out of GPU memory. The trade-off in numerical precision is usually minimal for inference workloads, while the performance gain is substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this FP8 + FlashInfer configuration is aimed at high-throughput, production-grade serving on 8×B200, where the priority is maximizing utilization and request throughput while still maintaining acceptable response quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=FLASHINFER_MLA \\\n",
    "VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP8=1 \\\n",

    "  --port 8000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NVFP4 on 8xB200\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration uses FlashInfer for MLA while switching MoE layers to NVFP4, a format optimized for NVIDIA architectures that provides a tighter balance between efficiency and output quality compared to raw FP8. NVFP4 reduces memory footprint substantially, allowing high batch concurrency and long-context serving without hitting capacity ceilings.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLA operations run on FlashInfer for fast attention kernels, and MoE experts are quantized to NVFP4. This keeps expert computation light without a critical loss in fidelity, making this option well-suited for heavy MoE workloads or cost-sensitive production environments. Keeping the KV cache in FP8 further reduces memory pressure.\n",

    "#### BF16 on 8xB200\n",
    "\n",
    "Running in full BF16 precision gives the highest numeric stability and preserves model quality, but it is considerably more memory-hungry than FP8 or FP4 variants. On an 8×B200 configuration, the model fits — but just barely — so the serving parameters need to be tightened to stay within the VRAM budget.\n",

    "\n",
    "Vision reasoning refers to the model’s ability to interpret visual inputs and apply logical inference on top of what it sees — not just recognizing objects, but understanding relationships, spatial context, cause-and-effect, and intent within an image. Instead of simply labelling elements, the model can describe scenes, infer actions, identify patterns, and answer questions that require comprehension rather than pattern-matching alone. This enables more advanced use cases such as analyzing diagrams, extracting information from charts, interpreting UI layouts, or evaluating photos for consistency and meaning. In short, vision reasoning bridges visual perception and conceptual understanding, allowing the model to think about images rather than merely see them."
